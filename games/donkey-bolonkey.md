Donkey Bolonkey is my entry for the
[SpeedHack 2001](http://www.speedhack.allegro.cc/), a competition of
creation of video games with the Allegro library in just three days.
The game is a clone of
[Rat Poker](http://www.microsoft.com/games/puzzle/ratpoker.htm) from
Microsoft Puzzle Collection, a
game created by the same author of the Tetris. The only difference is
that in Donkey Bolonkey you have to match donkeys instead of rats, and
it is several times gorier.

**21 Jan 2008**: Now the game can be played in a window
with pixels of double size. Also an icon was added.
