From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku):

> The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column,
> each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid
> (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares")
> contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
