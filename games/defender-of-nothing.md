A _anti-game_ that I did in three days for
[SpeedHack 2007](http://www.speedhack.allegro.cc/). It tries to be a
clone of [Defender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_%28game%29) but
it lacks basic concepts of every game, like gameover and the objective
to have to fight for some reason and against something.

The idea is as follow: You control the Devil and you must avoid that
angels takes humans to the heaven. So why angels are so worried about
to steal humans? Because God is realizing that less and less people
are going to heaven.

**19 Dec 2008**: Fixed a lot of bugs.
