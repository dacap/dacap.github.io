A long time ago, in the years where I used GNU/Linux, I could not
wait to load Emacs to make little changes in a configuration file.
So I found this little Emacs "clone".

[I made several contributions](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/zile.git/log/?qt=author&q=david+a.+capello),
mainly to fix serious bugs using text pointers.
[The biggest change which I made](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/zile.git/commit/?id=9c5a948f7a7b7eb4bfa9bc795dcb905b31bcea67)
is a refactor of everything related to points and markers which
must to be updated when a buffer is modified in other windows.
