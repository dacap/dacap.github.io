This year is ending and I was thinking of writing something
thoughtful, something about how the world is going down the drain,
with some kind of wishful conclusion. But I'm not in the mood.

The only thing I can think of is how technology is entering in a kind
of dumpster diving era. Where everything is considered trash, your
creations, your own pictures, your face, your retina, or even your
medical record, and they can be taken without any cost, to bring the
most outrageous tampered reality.

There is no shame in anonymity. But now big tech companies have no
anonymity, and no mortification either. It looks like being a public
shameless figure (or company) is the standard.  At least real dumpster
diving has the dignity of being done for survival. For these
companies: we are the trash.
