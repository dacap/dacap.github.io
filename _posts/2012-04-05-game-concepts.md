* Social Network Tycoon, you've to create and maintain
  your own social network, destroying the competition. [tweet](https://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/187894104837988352)
* Prepare as many [mates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29) as you can before it became washed out. [tweet](https://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/188373968632291328)
* Drink as much beer as you can without getting drunk. [tweet](https://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/188835537208094720)
* You are a book and you must find your writer... because you've a typo. [tweet](https://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/205112884160765952)
