This is a set of tools, projects, libraries, frameworks, etc. to
create web applications that I recommend you to check out. I'll be
modifying this list if I found more and more libraries. Feel free to
recommend one in the comments section below.

### Application logic at client side

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/): jQuery gives you an easy and portable
  way to query for DOM elements, create AJAX requests, create
  animation, etc. It's like the *de facto* framework to extend
  JavaScript.  There are others like
  [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/),
  [mootools](http://mootools.net/), etc.
* [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js): Templating
  engine at client side. You can render JSON objects to HTML.

### Style, HTML organization, and UI helpers

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/): All your
  website style should be based on this. Forget your way to layout HTML
  elements and CSS style, this is the *right way* to do it.
* [less](http://lesscss.org/): A dynamic stylesheet language. Useful
  to avoid duplicating colors/styles all over a CSS file.
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/): UI widgets and extensions to
  build really interactive pages with JavaScript and jQuery.
* [jQuery UI Layout](http://layout.jquery-dev.net/): A way to organize
  your page like a desktop app with docking panes. [Example](http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/example.html)
* [fancybox](http://fancybox.net/): A library to show screenshots
  with fancy transitions (depends on jQuery).

### Data visualization

* [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki): A super
  customizable open source JavaScript grid to display *a lot* of
  data. You'll need JavaScript knowledge to customize this
  grid, but it feels really good when you found a bug and you can fix
  it (also you can send [pull requests](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/pulls) to the
  author). [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/) uses this grid.
* [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/): Create zoomable charts.

### WebFonts & Icons

* [The League of Moveable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/):
  Open web fonts.
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/): A web
  font where each glyph is an icon.
* [Black & White Icons](http://www.codefear.com/graphics/20-free-black-white-icon-sets/)
